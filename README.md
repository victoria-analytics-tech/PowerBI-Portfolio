# Power BI Portfolio – Victoria Gardner

I’m transitioning into the field of Business Intelligence and Data Analytics, with the goal of relocating to Denmark and working in a values-aligned environment that prioritizes sustainability, transparency, and data that improves everyday life.

This portfolio is part of that journey — a space where I explore how thoughtful data storytelling can help build better systems and stronger communities.

## About Me

- Based in the USA (originally from Australia), with over 10 years of experience in Japan’s IT and marketing sectors.  
- Former clients include global corporations such as Sony and Mitsubishi, where I led international communication, cross-functional coordination, and data-driven marketing strategy.  
- Currently working remotely for a Japanese company and consulting independently while transitioning into BI.  
- Prior experience includes a university lecturing role in Japan, followed by client-facing positions in IT and project coordination.  
- Conversational Japanese speaker (JLPT N3, interviewed and hired in Japanese); I use Japanese daily at home with my toddler and am also actively learning Danish, which I practice with him through songs, simple phrases, and play.  
- Currently studying Power BI, SQL, DAX, and data storytelling, with a focus on real-world use cases.  
- Comfortable working in multicultural, cross-functional teams, and skilled at making complexity approachable.

## Why Denmark

I’m drawn to Denmark’s approach to:

- Human-centered urban design and digital-first public services  
- Walkable cities enriched by nature and community life  
- A data culture that values ethics, equity, and usability  
- A strong alignment between policy, environmental goals, and business practices  

My family and I are planning to relocate to Denmark by 2027. In the meantime, I’m actively building skills, projects, and relationships that reflect these values.
