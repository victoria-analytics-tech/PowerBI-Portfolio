# Fruit Sales Dashboard ‚Äì Month 1 Foundations Project

This is my very first Power BI dashboard, created as part of Month 1 in my learning journey toward a career in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics.

Rather than importing external files, I manually created a small table within Power BI to get hands-on experience with:

- Entering data directly in Power BI
- Creating and formatting visualizations
- Exploring the layout and customization options in the report canvas

##  What I Learned

This project helped me get comfortable with:

- Power BI Desktop's interface and workflow
- How to create a table and bar chart from scratch
- Formatting visuals (colors, labels, alignment)
- Saving and organizing Power BI files locally and on GitHub

##  Next Steps

I‚Äôll be building on this by:

- Connecting to Excel and CSV files
- Exploring slicers, filters, and calculated fields using DAX
- Publishing dashboards that reflect real-world themes like healthcare, sustainability, and public safety ‚Äî particularly with a Denmark focus

This first step marks the beginning of my transition into the world of data storytelling.
